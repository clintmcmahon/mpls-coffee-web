    <h1 class="About_title__EroSr">About MPLS Coffee</h1>
    <p class="About_text__2UxSe">MPLS Coffee is a free coffee locator app for Minneapolis, St. Paul and all around Minnesota. 
        The idea came from frustration over using mapping applications to try and find good coffee shops around us. 
        We decided to create an app that would show us all the independent coffee shops around and when they were open. Along with the location, we've include a list of features that make the app simple and useful. </p>
