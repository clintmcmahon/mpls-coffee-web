    <h1 class="fw-bold">Dogwood Coffee: A Higher Plane of Existence</h1>

    <p>Dogwood Coffee is not a café. It is a portal. A wormhole through which one passes, shedding their old understanding of coffee and emerging enlightened on the other side. The beans? Ethically sourced with the care of an ancient guild sworn to protect the sacred balance of flavor. The baristas? Guides, sages, fluent in the unspoken language of espresso and the delicate art of microfoam. The menu? A manifesto. No excess. No distractions. Just the pure, unfiltered essence of coffee, distilled into its most perfect form.</p>

    <p>You take your first sip and suddenly, the world shifts. The walls of the café stretch upward into infinity, the sounds of tamping and steaming forming a hypnotic rhythm. The espresso is smooth but complex, a layered composition of fruit, chocolate, and *something* else—an ineffable quality that suggests you may, in fact, be tasting the very essence of the universe itself. Around you, customers nod knowingly. They have been here before. They understand. The barista, without speaking, slides a perfectly dialed-in shot across the counter, as if to say, *Welcome. You belong here now.*</p>
