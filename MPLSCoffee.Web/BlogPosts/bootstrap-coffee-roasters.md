    <h1 class="fw-bold">Backstory Coffee Roasters: A Multi-Chapter Epic in the Art of Coffee</h1>

    <p>Backstory Coffee Roasters doesn’t just serve coffee—it unfolds it, like a novel that you can taste. Formerly known as Bootstrap Coffee, this St. Paul-born roastery has expanded its reach, bringing its carefully crafted, plot-twist-worthy coffee to multiple locations, including the North Loop. Every cup is a narrative arc, with beans sourced from farmers who care, roasted by people who understand that coffee isn’t just a drink—it’s a conversation between grower, roaster, and drinker.</p>

    <p>The St. Paul flagship retains its cozy, introspective feel, a sanctuary for those who like their mornings slow and their coffee complex. Meanwhile, the North Loop location brings Backstory’s refined simplicity to the heart of Minneapolis, a bright, modern space where espresso flows like poetry and pour-overs unfold like a well-paced novel. Whether you’re here for a cortado or a bag of beans to take home, Backstory ensures that every sip is worth reading into.</p>
