    <p>FRGMNT Coffee does not waste words. It does not waste space. It does not waste coffee. It exists in a state of pure intention, where every detail has been considered, examined, and deemed essential. Walking into FRGMNT is like stepping into a monastery devoted entirely to the worship of coffee, where silence is golden, distractions are nonexistent, and every cup is a meditation on the art of extraction.</p>

    <p>The menu is a study in restraint. No syrupy distractions, no chaos—just coffee, stripped down to its essence, revealing layers of complexity you didn’t know existed. The pour-overs are so precise, so quietly perfect, that you may find yourself involuntarily whispering, “Thank you” as the barista places your cup in front of you. In that moment, you are weightless. The city hums outside, but here, inside this temple of minimalism, there is only you, the coffee, and time itself unfolding like a perfectly brewed moment.</p>
